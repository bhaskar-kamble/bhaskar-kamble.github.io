with installing matplotlib in python3.6 - do it as superuser.

instead of pip install xyz, do python3.6 -m install xyz

In the file requirements.txt, change the version of matplotlib that is there.

also had to do sudo pip install jupyter (dont know why no python36 -m etc)

-------

in the pelicanconf.py file, i replaced PLUGIN_PATH by PLUGIN_PATHS and './plugins' by ['./plugins']. In this way I was able to avoid the warnings:
WARNING: PLUGIN_PATH setting has been replaced by PLUGIN_PATHS, moving it to the new setting name.
WARNING: Defining PLUGIN_PATHS setting as string has been deprecated (should be a list)
when I ran
