Because of this reason they seemed to be the perfect place to get started I first started exploring Python’s `matplotlib` package for its animation possibilities.

Of these 0 is the trivial case, and of the remaining four non-trivial cases, only two give unique curves. This is reminiscent of traveling waves on a system of infinite identical masses connected with springs and following periodic boundary conditions. In this case it will be remembered that if the masses repeat their motion every $N$ number of masses, where $N$ is odd, then there are $N$ normal modes. Of these, one is the trivial mode and the remaining $N – 1$ non-trivial normal modes are traveling waves with exactly $(N – 1)/2$ unique frequencies with two normal modes (one a wave in the positive direction and the other a wave in the negative direction) for each frequency.
