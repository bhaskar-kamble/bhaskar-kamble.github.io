    "I had recently played around quite a bit with animation possibilities in python, and had illustrated some of these possibilities in an earlier post. Shortly after that I busied myself with learning to create GUIs with the Tkinter package of python and came up with an interactive software which I decided to call “Planetary”. With this software one can create animations of a planet moving around the sun, or a comet deflected by it. As inputs one has to give the initial conditions – the initial x and y coordinates of the planet and the initial x and y components of the velocity. Using Newton’s laws and the Runge-Kutta-4 (RK4 for short) method to solve an ODE, the software then numerically computes the position of the planet as a function of time and creates an animation of the moving planet. While it is not possible to calculate the position of the planet as a function of time analytically (Kepler’s attempt to do so led to the so-called Kepler’s equation, which is a transcendental equation, see later section), it turns out that the path the planet follows in a gravitational field can be analytically calculated – and this path is a conic section, i.e. either an ellipse, parabola or hyperbola. (Of course exactly the reverse happened historically – the elliptical nature of the planetary orbits were first described by Kepler in his laws of planetary motion, and based on which Newton inferred the inverse square law for gravitation.) We will see later that, provided the time step in the RK4 method is chosen appropriately, the position of the planet as a function of time calculated numerically by the software using the RK4 method lies exactly on the analytically obtained orbit (hyperbola or ellipse).\n",

    "## The question of units\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to choose the proper system of units relevant to the physical system being considered. For example, kilometers would be an absurd choice of units when describing an atom! The proper system of units are especially important when we are dealing with numerical calculations, since the very large or very small numbers can lead to numerical errors. (For example, the mass of an electron in kg is of the order of 10-31 kg, which a computer could interpret as zero leading to errors such as division by zero etc. These extreme values also reduce the efficiency and accuracy of numerical methods.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the present context, we will set the gravitational constant $\\gamma$, the solar mass $M_S$ and the mean earth-sun distance $R$ equal to unity to fix our system of units. Finding the time unit is an exercise in dimensional analysis. Denoting the dimension of length as \\[L\\], the dimension of mass as \\[M\\] and the dimension of time as \\[T\\], the dimensions of the fundamental quantities (gravitational constant $\\gamma$, the mass of the sun $M_S$ and the earth-sun distance $R$) are given by\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "[\\gamma] &=& [L]^3[M]^{-1}[T]^{-2} \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    "[M_S] &=& [M] \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    "[R] &=& [L]\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "Let [T], the dimensions of time, be given by $[T] = [\\gamma]^a [MS]^b [R]^c$, where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are to be determined. Using the above equation this turns out to be $[T] = [M]^{–a+b}[L]^{3a+c}[T]^{-2a}$ , which gives $a = −1/2$, $b = −1/2$ and $c = 3/2$. So we have finally\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "[T] = [\\gamma]^{-\\frac{1}{2}}[M_S]^{-\\frac{1}{2}}[R]^{\\frac{3}{2}}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The units of time are therefore $\\sqrt{R^3/(γM_S)}$ which, substituting the values $\\gamma = 6.674×10^{−11} {\\rm m}^3 {\\rm kg}^{−1}{\\rm s}^{−2}$ , $M_S = 1.99×10^{30}$kg and $R = 1.496×10^{11}$m turns out to be $5.022 \\times 10^6$ s, which is equal to 58.125 days, or just under 2 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The planet’s position as a function of time\n",
    "\n",
    "Having found the equation of the orbit, it now remains to find the position of the planet as a function of time. This implies finding r(t) and θ(t). It turns out that there is no analytical, closed-form solution for r(t) and θ(t). In fact Kepler’s attempt to find the position as a function of the time led to the so-called Kepler’s equation, which is a transcendental equation. It is remarkable that this equation can be derived solely from the geometrical properties of the ellipse and without any knowledge of calculus. (See this link for a very clear derivation.) Kepler’s equation cannot be solved analytically but must be solved numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, with the knowledge of calculus and numerical methods at our disposal, it is much simpler to solve Newton’s equations directly than solving Kepler’s equation. This is exactly what has been done in the software.  From Newton’s laws, r and θ satisfy the following equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "{\\ddot r} - r{\\dot \\theta}^2 &=& -\\frac{\\gamma M_S}{r^2} \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    "r{\\ddot \\theta} + 2{\\dot r}{\\dot \\theta} &=& 0.\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "The first quantity is the radial acceleration which is proportional to the gravitational force of attraction, while the second is the angular acceleration which is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above system of coupled second order ordinary differential equations is solved in the software using the RK4 method. (The scipy.integrate package in Python can be used to solve ODEs directly, but I have implemented the RK4 algorithm myself in the software. In a future edition I plan to make use of this package. This link illustrates how scipy.integrate can be used.) This gives r and θ as a function of time.\n",

    "## Planetary: A demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "After the long, long description, I finally can start talking about what Planetary looks like! First I go to the directory where the python code is located and open the interface from the Linux terminal using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`python Planetary_04.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "The following window opens up:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/planetary/Shot01.jpg\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "The interface has a “Start” panel and a “Time plot” panel. The “Start” panel contains a short description of the software. When you click on the button for the “Time plot” panel, the following panel comes up:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/planetary/Shot02.jpg\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "This panel requests the user to provide the initial conditions based on which it will calculate the conic section for the orbit and the numerically calculate using RK4 the position of the planet as a function of time. The initial conditions it asks for are, as mentioned earlier, x, dx/dt, y, and dy/dt (which appear in the above panel as x(0), xdot(0), y(0) and ydot(0)). It also asks for the “time”, i.e. for what period of time should the software plot the planet’s position as a function of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The panel above already shows a few default values for these quantities. For the purposes of this demonstration I’m going to modify these values a little bit to make it physically more relevant. Specifically, I’m going to consider the case of the earth. As explained earlier, the mean earth-sun distance is our unit of distance and the time unit is 58.125 days, which equals 58.125/30 = 1.9375 months. The time taken by the earth to complete a revolution is 12 months, i.e. 12/1.9375 = 6.1935 time units. Hence the average angular velocity is 2π/6.1935 = 1.0145 radians/time. Now let us assume that at the initial time, the earth is on the x-axis at a distance of 1 distance unit (which in our case is the mean earth-sun distance 149.6 million km). This implies that x(0)=1 and y(0)=0. Let us also assume that the velocity here is perpendicular to the position vector of the earth from the sun, so that the initial xdot(0) = 0. Let the angular velocity be the average angular velocity 1.0145 radians/time, implying that ydot(0) = 1.0145 (since v = Rω). We give these data as input into the interface as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/planetary/Shot03.jpg\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "and click on the “Compute” button. The software will compute the path for 30 time units since this is the time we have specified in the “time” field. The RK4 method takes dt=0.01 time units as the time step in the numerical solution of the problem. One has to be careful that the time step is much smaller than the period of the planet’s orbit (practically one-hundredth of the period is good enough). The result of clicking on the “Compute” button is the following animation:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/planetary/Anim01.gif\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "The top left corner shows three numbers. These are the eccentricity of the orbit (e), the semi major axis of the ellipse (a) and the semi minor axis (b). The animation shows that the orbit is nearly circular with eccentricity about 0.03. This is roughly consistent with what we know of the earth’s orbit. However, the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit is 0.0167 (for example, see here or here) . Clearly the difference arises because we took the average earth-sun distance and the average angular velocity, along with the circumstance that the earth’s velocity is perpendicular to the position vector (so that it is either at the aphelion or perihelion), as the initial conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us try to do better. Let us take the actual parameters corresponding to the initial conditions as given on this NASA website in the section “Orbital parameters”. The aphelion is listed as 152.1 million km which in our units corresponds to a distance of 1.0167 distance units.  The table further lists the minimum orbital velocity as 29.29 km/s, which clearly occurs at the aphelion, since the aphelion is the point on the earth’s orbit which is furthest from the sun. If we convert to our system of units, 29.29 km/s corresponds to 0.9833 speed units. If the aphelion is chosen to lie on the x-axis, and if the planet is at the aphelion at the initial time, then again ydot(0)=0, while x(0)=1.0167, y(0)=0 and ydot(0)=0.9833. Let us put these values in the interface as in the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/planetary/Shot04.jpg\" width=300>\n",
    "\n",
    "and click on “Compute”. The result is the following animation:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/planetary/Anim02.gif\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "And now the eccentricity is 0.017, which is almost equal to the actual eccentricity of 0.0167, differing from it by less than 2 percent. However it is still not exact because we have not taken into account the perturbing effects of the other planets in the solar system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This particular example of the earth was just for a demonstration. One could equally well compare the orbits of the other planets in the solar system. A more ambitious project could be to include the perturbative effects of the other planets in our calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the animation at the beginning of the post the initial conditions are: x(0) = 1.6, xdot(0) = 0.3, y(0) = 0.8, ydot(0) = -0.3.\n",
