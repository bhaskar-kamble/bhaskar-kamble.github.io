    "This article introduces the idea of Fourier series from the approach of linear algebra. Starting with a system of coupled oscillators and introducing the idea of normal modes, the article shows how the wave equation and the Fourier series solution for different boundary conditions are natural consequences of the aforementioned system in the continuum limit. This approach to waves and Fourier series from a purely linear algebra perspective is usually not emphasized and can be an interesting way to revisit the topic."

    "# 2. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The subject of the normal modes of a discrete system of coupled oscillators and the Fourier series solution for the wave equation in a continuous medium play a central role in several branches of physics and engineering, and are also important from a pedagogic point of view. A number of articles have been published on the topic of normal modes of discrete systems, which have mainly dealt with the experimental observation of normal modes [1,2] and theoretical analyses of normal modes of finite one-dimensional lattices [3-10].  Interesting extensions to the quantum regime were carried out [11], and systems such as a spring with a finite mass [12,13], the Wilberforce pendulum [14] were also considered. Results of matrix algebra were applied to investigate normal mode analyses in linear spring-mass lattices where the end springs have arbitrary constants [8], as well as for triatomic chains [9] and defect lattices [10].\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, there have been several publications dealing with the oscillations of continuous systems and the Fourier spectrum analyses for these systems. These include experimental set-ups for demonstrating normal modes in strings and air-columns [15-17], illustrating the harmonic content of plucked strings through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and high-speed photography [18-19], theoretical analyses of decay in plucked strings [20],  and the modes of a compound string [21]. Fourier series expansion and an expansion in terms of Chebyshev polynomials were used to study inhomogeneous strings [22] as well, and uncertainty relations for Fourier transforms and Fourier series were obtained [23] paralleling the famous uncertainty relations of quantum mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the above publications are fascinating and interesting, what has been lacking is the connection between normal modes of a discrete system and the Fourier series solution for waves in a continuous medium. This is surprising considering that while the transition from Fourier series to the Fourier transform is generally well known, the topic of waves and the subsequent Fourier series solution for different boundary conditions is introduced directly starting with \n",
    "the continuum case without emphasizing its connection with the normal modes of a discrete system.\n",
    "However, a discrete system is intuitively simpler to understand, and it therefore appears natural to approach the topic of waves and Fourier series as an extension of this system. Armed with just the basic knowledge of the simple harmonic oscillator and some linear algebra, it is possible to show this connection, and that is precisely the aim of this article.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outline of this article is as follows: in Section I we recall the general properties of normal modes of a coupled oscillator system. In Section II we state the normal modes for a spring-mass for different boundary conditions. In Section III we recall the wave equation and the Fourier series solution for different boundary conditions. In Section IV we see how the discrete case transforms to the continuum case for the different boundary conditions, and we end with a summary in Section VI."

Then the force due to {\\it these} springs on the masses is $N_SK(a_0-x)$, where $a_0$ is the unstretched length of a spring, so that the pressure on the left is $P=N_SK(a_0-l)/S$. The volume enclosed between this cross section, the cross section adjacent to it on the left, and the cylinder  is $V=lS$. Then the incremental changes in the pressure and volume due to an incremental change in $l$ are, respectively, $dP=-(N_SK/S)dl$ and $dV=Sdl$. Hence the bulk modulus, $-VdP/dV$, equals $N_SKa/S$, where we have taken for $V$ its equilibrium value, $Sa$.\n",

The theorem states that if a continuous signal with a finite time period is sampled every $\\delta t$ seconds (with $\\delta t$ smaller than the time period), then the maximum frequency that will be described by the sampling is $(1/2)\\times2\\pi/\\delta t$. This can be seen as follows. If we associate the equilibrium position of the $n$th mass with the time when the $n$th sample is taken, and the distance $a$ between adjacent masses with the time interval $\\delta t$ between two consecutive samples, then $u_n(t)$ at $t=0$ can be compared to the $n$ samples of the signal. Thus, the wave number $k_m=2\\pi m/Na$ for the spring mass system is equivalent to the $m$th frequency of the time signal. The maximum value that $k_m$ can take is given by $m=(N-1)/2$ for odd $N$,  as seen by Eq. (38), and $N/2$ for even $N$. For the latter case, this equals $\\pi/a$, which is half of $2\\pi/a$. Comparing to the case of signals using the associations just outlined, this means that the maximum frequency described by the sampling is $\\pi/\\delta t$, which is half of $2\\pi/\\delta t$, which is exactly what the theorem says.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this article we approached the wave equation and the Fourier series solution for various boundary conditions purely as the limiting case of a system of discrete coupled oscillators. Starting with the discrete system, we obtained the normal modes for three different boundary conditions (fixed, open, and periodic) by diagonalizing the matrix appearing in the respective equation of motion. The amplitudes and phases of the masses in a normal mode are given by the eigenvectors while the frequencies are determined by the eigenvalues. In the continuum limit, the equations of motion approached the wave equation with the speed of the wave given in terms of the limiting values of the system parameters. An arbitrary motion of the masses is a linear combination of the normal modes, with the  coefficients determined by the initial conditions. In the continuum limit, this linear combination was shown to be identical to the Fourier series expansion for each of the three boundary conditions separately. The wavenumber and frequency of each Fourier mode were further shown to satisfy the dispersion relation in terms of the speed of the wave, obtained as the limiting value of the system parameters in the continuum limit. Further, it was shown that the coefficients in the normal modes expansion for the discrete system become identical to the Fourier coefficients in the continuum limit for each boundary condition separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is interesting to note that while the exact solutions for the normal modes for the spring-mass system used in this article are well known in the literature  for different boundary conditions, the close connection between these normal modes and the Fourier series solution is rarely emphasized. The approach in this article emphasizes this connection in a unified way and can be an interesting way to introduce or to revisit the topic. It can also be used as an initial point to understand other wave phenomena starting from this approach.\n"
