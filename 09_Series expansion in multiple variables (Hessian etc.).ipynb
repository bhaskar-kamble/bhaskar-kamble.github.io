The former corresponds to a maximum, and the latter to a minumum, as the first and second points in this list show. But to find out which of the two it is, we need one more condition. What is it? Well, let the extremum point be a minimum, to be concrete, let $(a,b)$ be the point. Now choose a line in the $xy$ plane which goes through this point and whose direction is parallel to the $x$-axis. Since a local minimum means that the point will be a minimum no matter which direction we choose, it will be a minimum along this line also. And along this line, $y$ has the constant value of $b$, and hence $f(x,y)=f(x,b)$ is just a function of $x$ ($y$ being constant). Now we know from the theory of functions of one variable that at a minimum the second derivative is positive. Keeping $y$ constant at the value $b$, the second derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$ at $x=a$ is thus positive at this point of minimum. However this second derivative is nothing else than $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}$, evaluated at the point $(a,b)$, which must thus be positive at a local minimum. And $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}$ is the element in the first row and first column of the Hessian: $H_{11}=\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}$. Hence if we have found that the point where the first derivatives vanish and established that the determinant of $H$ at this point is positive, then if we see that $H_{11}$ at this point is also positive, then we have established that we have a local minimum. By the way, a similar reasoning shows that $H_{22}$ also must be positive, because the point $(a,b)$ is a local minimum even when we take a path parallel to the $y$-axis and passing through $x=a$, for in this case again we have a function of one variable, the variable being $y$ in this case. Hence it suffices to show that either $H_{11}$ or $H_{22}$ is positive - the positivity of one ensures the positivity of the other.\n",

    "In the same way, if $det(H) > 0$, and if $H_{11}<0$, then we are dealing with a local maximum."
